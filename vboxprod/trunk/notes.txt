	- don't try to track serverid, let app do this
	
App keeps VM list

	yes - the app should be presented as a unified server. don't try to
	do things in extjs.. it makes hard things easy and easy things impossible
	
	vmlist or just id -> server mapping?
	
	when server comes online - get list of vms
	when server goes offline - remove list of vms
	
	vbox events must update internal list..
